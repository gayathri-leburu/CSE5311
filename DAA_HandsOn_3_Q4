If I modified the function to be:
x = f(n)
   x = 1;
   y = 1;
   for i = 1:n
        for j = 1:n
             x = x + 1;
        y = i + j;
4. Will this increate how long it takes the algorithm to run (e.x. you are timing the function like in #2)?


Yes, modifying the function to include the additional operation y = i + j 
within the nested loops will increase the time it takes for the algorithm to run. 
This is because now, for each iteration of the inner loop, there is an additional operation (y = i + j)
that needs to be performed, thus increasing the computational workload.


n	Time(microseconds)
1	1
2	1
3	1
4	1
5	1
6	1
7	1
8	1
9	1
10	2
20	2
30	2
50	6
100	17
150	38
200	56
500	281
1000	889
1500	2023
2000	3448


The runtme has increased for same values of n when compared with the function from #1.
