1. Implement a min heap data structure. For the parent and left/right functions use bit manipulation operators.
In addition your heap should have the following functionality

- The ability to initially build the heap (build_min_heap)
- The ability to heapify
- The ability to get and remove ("pop") the root node from the heap (and of course re-heapify everything)
- The heap should be generic to the type of data (can store floats, int, custom datastructure)
- Show example(s) of your heap working. Please demonstrate ALL the functionality you implemented.
- Upload your source code to github along with your example(s).

Enter the number of elements: 5

Enter 5 elements: 8 3 2 9 5

Heap: 2 3 8 9 5 

Root node removed from the heap: 2

Heap after removal:

Heap: 3 5 8 9
