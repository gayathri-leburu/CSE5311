T(n) of the function is in the order of O(n^2).
Therefore, the T(n) can be written as,
T(n) = c * n^2
Where c represents the constant time taken for each iteration of the inner loop.
In order to calculate Big-O, Big-Omega and Big-Theta:
Big-O (Upper Bound): The function is bounded above by O(n^2)..
Big-Omega (Lower Bound): The function is also bounded below by Ω(n^2).
Big-Theta (Tight Bound): Since upper and lower bounds are the same, 
                                             the big-theta notation is also, θ(n^2).
