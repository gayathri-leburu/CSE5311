Will it effect your results from #1?

This modification will not affect the results from step #1 regarding the algorithm's runtime analysis. 
The additional operation y = i + j does not change the overall time complexity of the algorithm, 
which is still dominated by the nested loops iterating from 1 to n. 
Therefore, the time complexity remains in the order of O(n^2).
